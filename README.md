# Strong-and-Easy-to-Remember-Password-Generator
A password generator that creates easy to remember, strong passwords by using four different word types: nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives.
The point is to make it as close as possible to a sentence, therefore being easier to remember regardless of complexity.

Currently limited to just a few words until I develop it further.
